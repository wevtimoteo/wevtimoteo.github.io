I've started working with Software Development in 2007 as a front-end developer then, in the same year, initiate a journey implementing some back-end stuff using PHP.

Since mid-of 2011 I've been working with Ruby and as I was advancing in my career path, I've been adding more and more tools to my toolkit such as iOS (Objective-c and Swift), Android (Java), Golang and Elixir (pairing with Ruby in my favorites list).

I enjoy a lot of RPG games and one of my hobbies is to study functional programming, focusing on Elixir and Haskell.
